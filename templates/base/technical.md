## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use This File

**As a technical expert, analyze this codebase and fill in sections below with a clear project overview:**

### Analysis Prompt for AI

```
As a technical expert, analyze this codebase and provide a clear project overview:

- Core Components: Describe the major components or modules, their 
  responsibilities, and any key classes or functions they contain. 
  Note any relevant design patterns or architectural approaches.

- Component Interactions: Explain how the components interact, including 
  data and control flow, communication methods, and any APIs or interfaces 
  used. Highlight use of dependency injection or service patterns if applicable.

- Deployment Architecture: Summarize the deployment setup, including build 
  steps, external dependencies, required environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod), 
  and infrastructure or containerization details.

- Runtime Behavior: Describe how the application initializes, handles requests 
  and responses, runs business workflows, and manages errors or background tasks.

Stay focused on providing a technical overview that helps a developer quickly 
understand how the system works. Avoid personal opinions or implementation 
suggestions unless specifically asked.
```

**Instructions:**
1. Paste the analysis prompt above to your AI agent
2. Replace sections below with AI-generated analysis
3. Keep it technical and focused
4. Update as architecture evolves

## Core Components

### [Component/Module Name]

**Responsibility:** What this component does

**Key Files/Classes:**
- `path/to/file.ts` - Purpose
- `path/to/another.ts` - Purpose

**Design Patterns:**
- [Pattern used, e.g., Factory, Singleton, Observer]

**Example:**
```typescript
// Brief code snippet showing usage
```

---

## Component Interactions

### Data Flow

```
[Entry Point]
  â†“
[Component A] â†’ [API/Service]
  â†“
[Component B] â†’ [Database]
  â†“
[Response/Result]
```

**Communication Methods:**
- REST API calls via `fetch`/`axios`
- Event emitters for real-time updates
- Direct function calls between modules

**Key Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface UserData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
```

---

## Deployment Architecture

### Build Process

```bash
npm run build    # Compiles TypeScript, bundles assets
npm run deploy   # Deploys to production
```

### Environments

- **Development:** `localhost:3000` - Hot reload enabled
- **Staging:** `staging.example.com` - Mirrors production
- **Production:** `example.com` - CDN + edge caching

### External Dependencies

- **Database:** PostgreSQL (connection pooled via `pg-pool`)
- **Storage:** AWS S3 for static assets
- **Cache:** Redis for session storage

### Infrastructure

- Containerized with Docker
- Orchestrated via Kubernetes/Docker Compose
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions

---

## Runtime Behavior

### Initialization

1. Load environment variables from `.env`
2. Establish database connections
3. Initialize middleware stack
4. Start HTTP server on configured port

### Request Lifecycle

```
HTTP Request
  â†’ Middleware (auth, logging)
  â†’ Route Handler
  â†’ Business Logic
  â†’ Database Query
  â†’ Response Formatting
  â†’ HTTP Response
```

### Error Handling

- Validation errors: Return `400 Bad Request`
- Auth failures: Return `401 Unauthorized`
- Unhandled exceptions: Log + return `500 Internal Server Error`

### Background Tasks

- Cron jobs for scheduled tasks (via `node-cron`)
- Queue processing for async work (via `bull` or `agenda`)

## Key Design Decisions

1. **[Decision]**: Why this approach was chosen
2. **[Trade-off]**: What was sacrificed and why it's acceptable
