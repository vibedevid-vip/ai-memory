## Memory System Workflow

**ALWAYS follow this sequence:**

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (this file) - Guidelines & commands
2. Read `technical_overview.md` - Architecture & components  
3. Read `PROGRESS.md` - History & current status
4. Implement feature
5. Verify with tests/lint
6. **Update `PROGRESS.md` before commit**
7. Commit & push

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Install
npm install

# Dev server
npm run dev

# Build & verify
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run test
```

**Add your project-specific commands above.** Remove placeholders.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript / JavaScript / Python / etc.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB / SQLite / etc.
- **Styling:** Tailwind / CSS Modules / etc.

**Update the list above with your actual stack.**

---

## Code Style

**Keep consistent with existing code:**
- Match indentation (spaces/tabs)
- Follow naming conventions in codebase
- Use types/interfaces where present
- Add comments only for complex logic

**Run before commit:**
```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
  ├── components/   # UI components
  ├── lib/          # Utilities
  ├── api/          # API routes
  └── db/           # Database
```

**Adjust structure above to match your project.**

## Verification Checklist

Before marking task complete:

- [ ] Code builds without errors
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Changes match requested scope
- [ ] `PROGRESS.md` updated with changes
- [ ] Reviewed `git diff` before commit

---

## Git Workflow

**On commit:**
1. Run `git status` and `git diff`
2. Update `PROGRESS.md` with changes
3. Stage: `git add <files>`
4. Commit with clear message
5. Push to remote

**Rule:** Never commit without updating `PROGRESS.md`.

---

## Best Practices

✅ **Keep this file ≤150 lines** - Brevity is clarity  
✅ **Use concrete commands** - Wrap in backticks for copy-paste  
✅ **Update with code** - Keep commands current  
✅ **Single source of truth** - Link to docs, don't duplicate  
✅ **Verify before merge** - Tests, lint, and confined diffs
